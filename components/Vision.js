          The world of luxury has evolved passed the physical and the material.
          To experience the full breath of luxury today is to enter a curated
          world; a world that understands oneâ€™s desires to be serviced in
          extravagance, entertained in excess, and provide you with more
          opportunities to indulge with others.

            Here at YCLUB, we unlock these experiences, giving unique access to

            Our vision is to provide Mega Yacht experiences, both in the
            Metaverse and IRL, for collectors looking to be a part of the
            extravagant worlds being built in Web3. Through this, collectors of
            YCLUB assets will have revenue share opportunities, membership
            access, and directly support cleaning the ocean through our green
            initiatives.
