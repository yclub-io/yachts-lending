          The world of luxury has evolved passed the physical and the material.
          To experience the full breath of luxury today is to enter a curated
          world; a world that understands oneâ€™s desires to be serviced in
          extravagance, entertained in excess, and provide you with more
          opportunities to indulge with others.

            Metaverse and IRL, for collectors looking to be a part of the
            extravagant worlds being built in Web3. Through this, collectors of
            YCLUB assets will have revenue share opportunities, membership

            initiatives.
